# Cognitive-Deep-Learning-with-TensorFlow
The majority of data in the world is unlabeled and unstructured, for instance images, sound, and text data. Shallow neural networks cannot easily capture relevant structures within this type of data, but deep networks are capable of discovering the hidden structures. In this course, you will use the TensorFlow library to apply deep learning on different types of data to solve real world problems.

## Learning Objectives
In this course you will learn about:
* Using TensorFlow for Deep Learning
* Breaking down images into their principal components and automatically generating a caption for it;
* Recommending movies, products, anything, based on what a certain person likes
* Processing incomplete sentences and predicting what was going to be written afterwards;
