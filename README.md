# Cognitive-Deep-Learning-with-TensorFlow
The majority of data in the world is unlabeled and unstructured, for instance images, sound, and text data. Shallow neural networks cannot easily capture relevant structures within this type of data, but deep networks are capable of discovering the hidden structures. In this course, you will use the TensorFlow library to apply deep learning on different types of data to solve real world problems.
